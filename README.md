# Hi there!

### Thanks for checking this repo

Here, I make a mini Information Management System using ReactJS and Redux Toolkit.

ðŸš¦ This is the same github as before. I just remove my commit history, because I forgot to hide my mongo pass & admin before ðŸ˜Š

### [Demo](https://addoffice.herokuapp.com/)

## Key Features

- Add company
- Add offices based on available companies
- Delete office item in Office Page
- Delete company. When delete this, all of the office under the company is deleted too
- Show company in Office Page and show the office under the company
- Sort company and office item by newest added
- Specific input requirement

Mini Features (include):

- Popup information for interactions
- Skeleton loading
- Tooltip to handle long name (office)

## Development

`git clone`

`cd api` and then `npm install`

`cd api` `cd client` then `npm install`

Then, you can run this web-app using `npm start` from the client.

To start from the server, run `npm run start` from api path, then open `localhost:5000` in your browser. Don't forget to build the client first.

To start concurrently with the server, you can run `npm start:dev` from api path.
